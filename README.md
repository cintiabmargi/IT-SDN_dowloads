# IT-SDN_dowloads
IT-SDN is a Software Defined Wireless Sensor Network (SDWSN) tool that is completely open and freely available, designed to be independent of the operating system and its functions. Although it is inspired by TinySDN (a previous work on my research group), we improved the architecture, protocols and implementation. 

Requeriments
The IT-SDN framework version presented here was developed under Contiki OS 3.0 and the controller software was developed in C and C++ with Qt.
